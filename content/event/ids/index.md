abstract: In standard claims reserving, practitioners aggregate individual data into triangles to model the underlying process with some well known reserving technique. In individual claims reserving, data are disentangled and treated as supervised learning problem. The peculiar form of a reserving data set forces the practitioner to deal with truncated time-series. A possible solution available in the literature is to select a one-period supervised learning model that process each development year separately. One possible approach is to base the individual predictions on multilayer perceptrons. On the other hand, while stochastic claims reserving assess both process uncertainty and model uncertainty, multilayer perceptrons do not provide an estimate of the variability which is necessary for capital requirement purposes. The novel of this work is to provide the first bayesian neural networks implementation of an individual one-period model based on the individual Chain-Ladder that allows to assess the individual reserves.
