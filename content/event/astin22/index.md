abstract: GEMAct is an actuarial Python package, based on the collective risk theory framework, that offers a comprehensive set of tools for insurance and reinsurance pricing, stochastic claims reserving, risk theory modeling, and risk aggregation. For example, the packageconsiders a collective risk model apparatus to price non-life non-proportional reinsurance contracts, including individual and aggregate conditions and allowing for reinstatements, and to estimate both proportional and non-proportional reinsurance loss reserves. Furthermore, it is possible to compute quantiles of the risks aggregate distribution, via an efficient implementation of the AEP algorithm, to implement multi-annual ruin theory analysis, and to perform profitability tests over the selected time-horizon. The variety of available functionalities makes GEMAct modeling very flexible and provides actuarial scientists and practitioners with a powerful tool that fits into the expanding community of Python programming language.
