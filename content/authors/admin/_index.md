I am a Ph.D. student in actuarial science at the Sapienza, University of Rome. 

My research interests include machine learning with application to claims reserving and computational methods for non-life insurance. 

Currently, I am a visiting Ph.D. student at the University of Copenhagen and external examiner at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart for the course *Non-life insurance*.
